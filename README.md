# Spin Doctor

Spin Doctor is a WebExtension to help front-end Firefox engineers detect really short tab switch spinners. These aren't normally visible to the naked eye, but they show up in our telemetry.

# Installation

Visit the [docs/](https://mikeconley.github.io/spindoctor/) page for installation instructions and links.

# TODO
* Add ability to disable the sound effect
